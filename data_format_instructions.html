<p>This tool uses the package terradactyl which was built to use data
from the <a href="https://blm.gov/aim">Bureau of Land Management’s
Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring program (AIM)</a>. This means that
there are certain variables that are required in the input data. If you
choose to upload data, you must ensure that these variables exist in
your data or else the tool will be unable to calculate statistics from
them. These variables are the bare minimum; you may have additional
variables in your data. All of these are assumed to be in long format
unless otherwise stated.</p>
<div id="line-point-intercept" class="section level2">
<h2>Line-Point Intercept</h2>
<div id="primarykey" class="section level3">
<h3>PrimaryKey</h3>
<p><code>PrimaryKey</code> must contain the unique identifier for each
sampling event at a sampling location, e.g. a plot visit. All records
from the same sampling event must have the same primary key value. If a
sampling location was visited more than once, each visit’s records
should have a unique primary key value.</p>
</div>
<div id="code" class="section level3">
<h3>code</h3>
<p>The variable <code>code</code> (all lowercase) must contain the codes
for what was intercepted by the pin in each layer at each point along
the line/transect, either the species code (e.g., <code>&quot;ARTR2&quot;</code>)
or surface code (e.g., <code>&quot;S&quot;</code>). Valid codes can be found in
volume I of the <a href="https://www.landscapetoolbox.org/methods-manuals/monitoring-manual-2nd-edition/">Monitoring
Manual for Grassland, Shrubland, and Savanna Ecosystems</a> under the
rules for the line-point intercept method.</p>
</div>
<div id="pointnbr" class="section level3">
<h3>PointNbr</h3>
<p><code>PointNbr</code> must contain the ordinal number for the pin
drop along its transect, e.g., all records from the first pin drop on a
transect would have the value <code>1</code> while all records from the
second pin drop on that transect would have the value
<code>2</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="layer" class="section level3">
<h3>layer</h3>
<p>The variable <code>layer</code> (all lowercase) must contain the
layer on the pin drop that the record comes from. Valid values include
<code>&quot;TopCanopy&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;Lower#&quot;</code> where each subsequent
lower canopy layer uses the next ordinal number (e.g.,
<code>&quot;Lower1&quot;</code>), and <code>&quot;SoilSurface&quot;</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="height" class="section level2">
<h2>Height</h2>
<div id="primarykey-1" class="section level3">
<h3>PrimaryKey</h3>
<p>PrimaryKey must contain the unique identifier for each sampling event
at a sampling location, e.g. a plot visit. All records from the same
sampling event must have the same primary key value. If a sampling
location was visited more than once, each visit’s records should have a
unique primary key value.</p>
</div>

<div id="gap" class="section level2">
<h2>Gap</h2>
<div id="primarykey-2" class="section level3">
<h3>PrimaryKey</h3>
<p>PrimaryKey must contain the unique identifier for each sampling event
at a sampling location, e.g. a plot visit. All records from the same
sampling event must have the same primary key value. If a sampling
location was visited more than once, each visit’s records should have a
unique primary key value.</p>

<h2>Soil Stability</h2>
<div id="primarykey-3" class="section level3">
<h3>PrimaryKey</h3>
<p>PrimaryKey must contain the unique identifier for each sampling event
at a sampling location, e.g. a plot visit. All records from the same
