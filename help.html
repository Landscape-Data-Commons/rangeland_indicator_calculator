<h2>Data configuration</h2>
<p>Terradactyl was developed specifically to work with <a href="https://blm.gov/aim">AIM</a> data and therefore has certain
expected/required fields for each type of data. You may also see the <a href="https://www.landscapetoolbox.org/methods-manuals/monitoring-manual-2nd-edition/">Monitoring
Manual for Grassland, Shrubland, and Savanna Ecosystems Vol. 1</a> for
additional method details, including valid codes for certain variables.
You must specify a corresponding variable for all required fields. You
may have additional variables in your data beyond the minimum specified
here. Note that all incoming data must be in long format: each row in
the data must represent one observation and each column is a variable
associated with the observation. For Line-Point Intercept each
observation is a single hit with the pin; for heights, a single height;
for gap, a single gap; and for soil stability, a single soil sample.</p>
<div id="primary-key" class="section level4">
<h4>Primary key</h4>
<p>This must contain a unique value for each sampling event, e.g., plot
visit. All records associated with a plot visit should have the same
primary key, but if a plot was sampled more than once, each sampling
event should have its own distinct primary key. If your data contain a
variable called <code>PrimaryKey</code> then the tool will assume it
contains primary keys.</p>
</div>
<div id="line-key" class="section level4">
<h4>Line key</h4>
<p>This must contain a unique value for each transect used during a
sampling event. All records associated with that transect during that
sampling event must have the same line key. Each transect in your data
set should have a unique line key; non-unique line keys can result in
calculation errors. If your data contain a variable called
<code>LineKey</code> then the tool will assume it contains line
keys.</p>
</div>
<div id="hit-codes" class="section level4">
<h4>Hit codes</h4>
<p>In Line-Point Intercept, every record has an associated code
corresponding to what the pin touched in that layer. This variable
contains species codes as well as other codes, e.g., <code>S</code> for
“soil” or <code>WL</code> for “woody litter”. See the <a href="https://www.landscapetoolbox.org/methods-manuals/monitoring-manual-2nd-edition/">Monitoring
Manual for Grassland, Shrubland, and Savanna Ecosystems Vol. 1</a> for
information on valid codes. If your data contain a variable called
<code>code</code> then the tool will assume it contains the hit
codes.</p>
</div>
<div id="ordinal-hit-numbers" class="section level4">
<h4>Ordinal hit numbers</h4>
<p>In Line-Point Intercept, every record has an ordinal number
corresponding to where on a transect it was collected, e.g. all records
from the first pin drop on a transect would have <code>1</code>, records
from the second would have <code>2</code>, and so on. These must be the
same for all records associated with a single pin drop. If your data
contain a variable called <code>PointNbr</code> then the tool will
assume it contains the ordinal hit numbers.</p>
</div>
<div id="layer" class="section level4">
<h4>Layer</h4>
<p>In Line-Point Intercept, every record has an associated layer
indicating where it comes from in the vertical slice. For records
corresponding to the uppermost canopy hit at a pin drop, the value must
be <code>&quot;TopCanopy&quot;</code>. For all other canopy codes, the format is
“Lower” plus an ordinal number, e.g. <code>&quot;Lower1&quot;</code> for the first
record after the top canopy, <code>&quot;Lower2&quot;</code> for the next record,
and so on. The bottom record for a pin drop, the surface hit, must have
a value of <code>&quot;SoilSurface&quot;</code>. If your data contain a variable
called <code>layer</code> then the tool will assume it contains the
layer information.</p>
</div>
<div id="heights" class="section level4">
<h4>Heights</h4>
<p>With height data, each record has an associated numeric height value.
This variable contains those data. If your data contain a variable
called <code>Height</code> then the tool will assume it contains the
height information.</p>
</div>
<div id="species" class="section level4">
<h4>Species</h4>
<p>With height data, there must be an associated species with each
height record. This variable should contain the species information,
typically using species codes. If the height was 0 for a record (e.g.,
no woody plant qualified to be measured at a sampling point) then the
value should be <code>&quot;None&quot;</code>. If your data contain a variable
called <code>Species</code> then the tool will assume it contains the
species information.</p>
</div>
<div id="line-lengths" class="section level4">
<h4>Line lengths</h4>
<p>In gap calculations, the lengths of the lines/transects are critical.
This variable must contain the line length for each transect in the same
type of units as the gap sizes, i.e., in meters if the gaps are recorded
in centimeters and in feet if the gaps are recorded in inches. The value
should be the same for all records from the same transect. If your data
contain a variable called <code>LineLengthAmount</code> then the tool
will assume it contains the line lengths.</p>
</div>
<div id="measurement-units" class="section level4">
<h4>Measurement units</h4>
<p>In gap calculations, length unit type must be specified. For each
record, this variable must contain either <code>1</code> if using metric
units (centimeters for gap sizes and meters for line lengths) or
<code>2</code> if using imperial units (inches for gap sizes and feet
for line lengths). If your data contain a variable called
<code>Measure</code> then the tool will assume it contains the unit
type.</p>
</div>
<div id="type-of-gap" class="section level4">
<h4>Type of gap</h4>
<p>A gap data set may contain more than one type of gap: all canopy,
perennial canopy only, and basal. This variable must contain the type of
gap that each record represents. For gaps that take into account all
canopy types, the value must be <code>&quot;C&quot;</code>; for perennial-only,
<code>&quot;P&quot;</code>; and for basal, <code>&quot;P&quot;</code>. If your data contain
a variable called <code>RecType</code> then the tool will assume it
contains the type of gap.</p>
</div>
<div id="gap-size" class="section level4">
<h4>Gap size</h4>
<p>Each gap data record must represent one measured gap and include the
size of the gap. This variable must contain a numeric value
corresponding to the size of the gap in either centimeters or inches
(see measurement units above). If your data contain a variable called
<code>Gap</code> then the tool will assume it contains the gap
sizes.</p>
</div>
<div id="stability-ratings" class="section level4">
<h4>Stability ratings</h4>
<p>In soil stability data, every record must have a numeric rating. This
variable contains that rating. If your data contain a variable called
<code>Rating</code> then the tool will assume it contains the
ratings.</p>
</div>
<div id="vegetative-cover" class="section level4">
<h4>Vegetative cover</h4>
<p>In soil stability data, every record must have an associated
vegetative cover designation. See the <a href="https://www.landscapetoolbox.org/methods-manuals/monitoring-manual-2nd-edition/">Monitoring
Manual for Grassland, Shrubland, and Savanna Ecosystems Vol. 1</a> for
information on valid codes. If your data contain a variable called
<code>Veg</code> then the tool will assume it contains the vegetative
cover types.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="indicator-configuration" class="section level2">
<h2>Indicator configuration</h2>
<div id="line-point-intercept" class="section level3">
<h3>Line-Point Intercept</h3>
<div id="any-hit-versus-first-hit" class="section level4">
<h4>Any hit versus first hit</h4>
<p>There are two options for which “hit” to calculate from with LPI
data. When a pin is dropped during LPI, all intercepted canopy layers
and the soil surface are recorded. When calculating using “any hit” then
every layer is considered as contributing to cover while ““first hit”
only considers the topmost recorded hit. For example, if a pin first
touches a perennial forb then an annual grass, using “first hit” would
ignore the annual grass record and that would not contribute to the
percent cover by annual grass because it was not the topmost recorded
cover. If using “any hit” then the perennial forb would contribute to
cover by perennial forbs <em>and</em> the annual grass would contribute
to to cover by annual grasses.</p>
<p>When using “first hit” all your calculated cover values on a plot
will sum to 100%. When using “any hit” 100% is the minimum total cover
possible; if any pin drops recorded more than one hit, then the sum of
cover values will exceed 100%. “Any hit” is the default because it
provides the most information from the data and doesn’t exclude any
records, offering the most comprehensive characterization. “First hit”
was added as an option for those working with remote sensing products
who had requested something that might approximate the aerial or
satellite view of the landscape, however it can be argued that “any hit”
is in fact more representative.</p>
</div>
<div id="grouping-variables" class="section level4">
<h4>Grouping variables</h4>
<p>These are additional variables beyond the sampling location to group
the data by for calculating cover. The default behavior is to group by
sampling location and calculate the percent cover for that location. In
order to calculate finer-grained cover values, additional grouping
variables need to be selected. For example, in order to calculate cover
by species for each sampling location, the variable containing the
species codes or names would need to be selected. The selected variables
are additive, so selecting both a variable containing plant duration and
a variable containing plant growth habit would result in cover being
calculated for each combination of those two, e.g., annual forbs and
perennial grasses.</p>
</div>
<div id="summarization-unit" class="section level4">
<h4>Summarization unit</h4>
<p>Cover can be calculated by plot (each unique primary key value) or by
line (each unique combination of primary key and line key). It is
generally not recommended that you calculate by line, especially if you
have fewer than 100 records per line.</p>
</div>
<div id="output-format" class="section level4">
<h4>Output format</h4>
<p>The output can be either long or wide. In long format, each
<em>observed</em> indicator is represented by a row. This means that if
you have supplied <code>code</code> as your grouping variable, only
those codes which appeared on your summarization unit will have a row
representing them. This is in contrast to wide format in which every
possible indicator has a column in the results and they will have a
value of 0 for summarization units where they were not observed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="height" class="section level3">
<h3>Height</h3>
<div id="omit-0-heights" class="section level4">
<h4>Omit 0 heights</h4>
<p>Height records with a value of 0 may be excluded from calculations.
If they are included, then the heights reported represent the
summarization unit on the whole whereas excluding 0 heights means that
the reported values represent only the standing vegetation which was
measured.</p>
</div>
<div id="grouping-variables-1" class="section level4">
<h4>Grouping variables</h4>
<p>These are additional variables beyond the sampling location to group
the data by for calculating mean heights. The default behavior is to
group by sampling location and calculate the mean or max height for that
location. In order to calculate finer-grained height values, additional
grouping variables need to be selected. For example, in order to
calculate height by species for each sampling location, the variable
containing the species codes or names would need to be selected. The
selected variables are additive, so selecting both a variable containing
plant duration and a variable containing plant growth habit would result
in heights being calculated for each combination of those two, e.g.,
annual forbs and perennial grasses.</p>
</div>
<div id="summarization-unit-1" class="section level4">
<h4>Summarization unit</h4>
<p>Mean heights can be calculated by plot (each unique primary key
value) or by line (each unique combination of primary key and line key).
It is generally not recommended that you calculate by line, especially
if you have fewer than 100 records per line.</p>
</div>
<div id="output-format-1" class="section level4">
<h4>Output format</h4>
<p>The output can be either long or wide. In long format, each
<em>observed</em> indicator is represented by a row. This means that if
you have supplied <code>code</code> as your grouping variable, only
those codes which appeared on your summarization unit will have a row
representing them. This is in contrast to wide format in which every
possible indicator has a column in the results and they will have a
value of 0 for summarization units where they were not observed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="gap" class="section level3">
<h3>Gap</h3>
<div id="breakpoints" class="section level4">
<h4>Breakpoints</h4>
<p>Gap data are classified into size classes and the indicators reported
are percent of the sampling location composed of gaps in each size
class. The break values define the minimum gap size and what values to
split the data at. The values must be listed in ascending order and
separated by commas. The first value acts as the minimum gap size while
the maximum gap size is infinity. As an example, in order to calculate
cover for three size classes, one from 20 cm to 50 cm, one for 51 to 100
cm, and one for greater than 100 cm, the breaks would be
<code>20, 51, 101</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="gap-type" class="section level4">
<h4>Gap type</h4>
<p>There are three available types of gap that can be calculated. They
are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Canopy - Gaps in canopy, considering both annual and perennial
plants. This uses only records where the cover type variable value is
<code>&quot;C&quot;</code></li>
<li>Basal - Gaps between plant bases at the soil surface, considering
both annual and perennial plants. This uses only records where cover
type variable value is <code>&quot;B&quot;</code></li>
<li>Perennial canopy - Gaps in canopy, considering only perennial
plants. This uses only records where the cover type variable value is
<code>&quot;P&quot;</code></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="summarization-unit-2" class="section level4">
<h4>Summarization unit</h4>
<p>Gaps can be calculated by plot (each unique primary key value) or by
line (each unique combination of primary key and line key). It is
generally not recommended that you calculate by line because your plot
is likely the unit of replication.</p>
</div>
<div id="output-format-2" class="section level4">
<h4>Output format</h4>
<p>The output can be either long or wide. In long format, each row is
represents one statistic for your summarization unit, e.g., a row would
be your summarization unit, the gap size class, the statistic name, and
the statistic value. In wide format, each row is a single summarization
unit and each statistic has a column.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="soil-stability" class="section level3">
<h3>Soil Stability</h3>
<div id="vegetative-cover-grouping" class="section level4">
<h4>Vegetative cover grouping</h4>
<p>Soil stability data includes the vegetative cover at the location
where a soil sample was collected. The mean can be calculated in a few
ways using vegetative cover. It can be summarized by considering:</p>
<ul>
<li>For soil samples with <code>all cover types</code></li>
<li>For only those soil samples that had
<code>perennial cover</code></li>
<li>For only those soil samples that did not have perennial cover
(considered <code>no cover</code>)</li>
<li>All soil stability samples, but <code>by cover type</code>,
producing a mean for each cover type</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="output-format-3" class="section level4">
<h4>Output format</h4>
<p>The output can be either long or wide. In long format, each
<em>observed</em> indicator is represented by a row. This means that if
you have supplied <code>code</code> as your grouping variable, only
those codes which appeared on your summarization unit will have a row
representing them. This is in contrast to wide format in which every
possible indicator has a column in the results and they will have a
value of 0 for summarization units where they were not observed.</p>
