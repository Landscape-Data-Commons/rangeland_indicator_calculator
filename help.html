<h3>Line-Point Intercept</h3>
<div id="any-hit-versus-first-hit" class="section level4">
<h4>Any hit versus first hit</h4>
<p>There are two options for which “hit” to calculate from with LPI
data. When a pin is dropped during LPI, all intercepted canopy layers
and the soil surface are recorded. When calculating using “any hit” then
every layer is considered as contributing to cover while ““first hit”
only considers the topmost recorded hit. For example, if a pin first
touches a perennial forb then an annual grass, using “first hit” would
ignore the annual grass record and that would not contribute to the
percent cover by annual grass because it was not the topmost recorded
cover. If using “any hit” then the perennial forb would contribute to
cover by perennial forbs <em>and</em> the annual grass would contribute
to to cover by annual grasses.</p>
<p>When using “first hit” all your calculated cover values on a plot
will sum to 100%. When using “any hit” 100% is the minimum total cover
possible; if any pin drops recorded more than one hit, then the sum of
cover values will exceed 100%. “Any hit” is the default because it
provides the most information from the data and doesn’t exclude any
records, offering the most comprehensive characterization. “First hit”
was added as an option for those working with remote sensing products
who had requested something that might approximate the aerial or
satellite view of the landscape, however it can be argued that “any hit”
is in fact more representative.</p>

<h3>Gap</h3>
<div id="breaks" class="section level4">
<h4>Breaks</h4>
<p>Gap data are classified into size classes and the indicators reported
are percent of the sampling location composed of gaps in each size
class. The break values define the minimum gap size and what values to
split the data at. The values must be listed in ascending order and
separated by commas. The first value acts as the minimum gap size while
the maximum gap size is infinity. As an example, in order to calculate
cover for three size classes, one from 20 cm to 50 cm, one for 51 to 100
cm, and one for greater than 100 cm, the breaks would be
<code>20, 51, 101</code>.</p>

<h3>Height</h3>
<div id="statistic" class="section level4">
<h4>Statistic</h4>
<p>There are two available height statistics: mean and maximum. Both are
calculated per-group, so by default they are the mean or maximum height
value observed at a sampling location.</p>

<div id="soil-stability" class="section level3">
<h3>Soil Stability</h3>
<div id="vegetative-cover-grouping" class="section level4">
<h4>Vegetative cover grouping</h4>
<p>Soil stability data includes the vegetative cover at the location
where a soil sample was collected. The mean can be calculated in a few
ways using vegetative cover. It can be summarized by considering:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>All</code> soil stability values regardless of what kind of
vegetative cover the samples had</li>
<li>For only those soil samples that had
<code>perennial cover</code></li>
<li>For only those soil samples that did not have perennial cover
(considered <code>no cover</code>)</li>
<li>All soil stability samples, but <code>by cover type</code>,
producing a mean for each cover type</li>
</ul>
