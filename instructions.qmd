1)  Select the type of data you will be working with and either upload a CSV file containing the data or download the appropriate data from the [Landscape Data Commons (LDC)](https://landscapedatacommons.org/). If downloading from the LDC, you must specify how you're searching for data (by ecological site ID, project key, or primary key) and the values to search for, separated by commas, e.g. *R042XB012NM, R036XB006NM*.

2)  In the "Data configuration" tab, confirm the variables in your data which correspond to the required variables then click the "Update data variables" button. Optionally, you may choose to also add species information via joining from a lookup table. If you make a mistake with either, you can reset your data under the "Data" tab.

3) In the "Indicator calculation" tab select the options for the indicators you wish to calculate then use the "Calculate" button to produce results in the "Results" tab.
