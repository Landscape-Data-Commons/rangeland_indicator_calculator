1)  Select the type of data you will be working with and either upload a CSV file containing the data or download the appropriate data from the [Landscape Data Commons (LDC)](https://landscapedatacommons.org/). If downloading from the LDC, you must specify how you're searching for data. This can be done spatially with your own polygons by uploading a ZIP file containing the files that make up a polygon shapefile or a ZIP containing a geodatabase with the polygons as a feature class. If you would rather, you can instead search by ecological site IDs, project keys, or primary keys.

2)  In the "Data configuration" tab, confirm the variables in your data which correspond to the required variables; they should be correct already if your data come from the LDC. Optionally with LPI and height data, you may choose to also add species information via joining from a lookup table. If you make a mistake when joining species information, you can reset your data under the "Data" tab.

3)  In the "Indicator calculation" tab select the options for the indicators you wish to calculate then use the "Calculate" button to produce results in the "Results" tab.
